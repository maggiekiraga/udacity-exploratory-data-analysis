    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " > **Aim of the project**: The main goal of this project is to investigate relationships between specific life expectancy indicators and life expectancy. The analyses will be performed for a country representing the most and the least developed areas of the world to check for eventual discrepancies in indicators' significance.\n",
    " \n",
    "> **Data selection**: Data sets available on Gapminder were used to assess the goals of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Datasets justification/specification**: Information found on an external source (listed below) stated that life expectancy is generally significantly different for men and women. For the purposes of the current project, and due to the time constraints, I chose to work further with the female data, although investigation of the male data sets, could provide a deeper understanding of if and how the sex differences might be related to life expectancy and its indicators. Therefore **the dependent variable** for this study is: female life expectancy. The external sources were also used to determine the factors that will be investigated in the current project as potential indicators of life expectancy. The following **independent variables (variable name)** have been chosen: 1) body mass index (BMI), 2) blood cholesterol levels (Cholesterol), 3) new cancer cases per 100 000 residents (Cancer), 4) the percentage of total employees working in the industry (Industry), and 5) the percentage of women above 15 years old that smokes (Smoking). When making the choice about which cancer type to include in the analyses, the breasts cancer has been chosen, as it is worldwide the most commonly diagnosed cancers among women. The analyses were performed for the **year range**: 1980-2008, as for this period of time the data was available for most (but not all) of the investigated variables. Further on, I thought it would be important to investigate at least one developed and developing country, and later on, compare them to each other. One more time, I sought out an external resource to make a decision about which countries to choose. As it goes for the developed countries, Norway has currently the highest Human Development Index (HDI) worldwide. However, for the current project, I chose **Switzerland** (second in the ranking) as a representative of developed countries, as its data sets required more cleaning and included null values, something that I was hoping for, as it offers more learning opportunities. As it goes for the developing countries, I chose **Somalia** similarly simply because it has the lowest HDI and some incomplete data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Research questions**: \n",
    "> 1. Which of the independent variables are the best predictors of life expectancy? In other words, what is the best-fit model for life expectancy in developing and developed countries? \n",
    "> 2. Do, and if yes how the developing and developed countries differ in terms of the predictive value of the independent variables? In other words, are there differences in terms of the variable's significance between developing and developed countries? \n",

During the initial exploration (in another notebook) of the cancer data set, I discovered that out of all 184 countries, four of them are having no missing values for this data set: Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Therefore I decided to do some visual data exploration to check how their data was distributed in the years 1980-1989, and later on, use those findings to fill the missing data for Somalia and Switzerland.

    "Although some fluctuations are present during the first 9 years of data collection, we can observe a general increase in cancer cases during that period. Because all of the countries are showing a quite steep, linear growth, using row mean values to fill NaN values seems to be a bit oversimplified. Therefore I chose to use a linear interpolation function to fill backward the null values in my dataset. It appeared to me as the best solution, given the above exploration of the values available for this data set. "

We can observe that most of the variables show a quite stable longitudinal pattern of values. Moreover, we can see that the life expectancy in both countries is increasing, while the rate of increase seems to be higher for Somalia. Among independent variables, the number of new cancer cases and the percentage of industrial workers in Switzerland show the steepest decrease in the past few years.\n",

    "On the above figure, we can see that Switzerland scores higher than Somalia on all of the variables. The biggest difference seems to be on rates of newly diagnosed cancer cases. We need to keep in mind that there might be multiple explanations of this observation, with longer life expectancy, better health care, and more diagnostic tests in Switzerland, being just one of them. The smallest differences between the countries seem to be on measurements of BMI and cholesterol levels in the blood. However, it is important to keep in mind that the y-axis depicts absolute values, whereas the variables' values are measured on different scales (numerical, percentage, ratio), so comparing the magnitude of differences between the variables doesn't make a lot of sense. \n",

    "The above figure presents the density distribution for each of the variables in each of the countries. More precisely, for a given variable, it shows us the distribution of values across the years. For example, considering the case of the dependent variable: life expectancy, we can see that most of the values for the Somalia distribution are in the ranges: 46-48 and 53-55, the two peaks on the graph. The values in between are much less common in the dataset. In the case of Switzerland's life expectancy, we can see that all the values from the data (range 79-84) are very evenly distributed, their distribution looks similar to the well known normal distribution. For each of the subfigures, a KDE plot has also been created, which is a sort of probability estimation function based on the values in data set. The plot is scattered between the minimum and maximum values for a given variable, with 'bumps' of density distribution, representing a higher number of data points around this area. The disputable character of the Smoking data frame, is easily noticeable on the above figure, as it stands out from the rest. For cases like plotting the density distribution is of course without any value. "

    "The following observation can be drawn based on the above figure: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is a positive correlation between BMI and life expectancy: the higher the BMI, the higher one's life span. This is observation is quite intuitive, as people are more likely in Somalia to die because of food deprivation rather than the surplus of food, and diseases it might cause. Moreover, even the highest BMI values in Somalia are still to be perceived as healthy, as they are smaller than 25. \n",
    " \n",
    "2. There is a negative correlation between levels of 'bad' cholesterol in blood and life expectancy: people with the lowest measurements on this variable tend to live the longest. Interestingly, this correlation seems to be the most pronounced for cholesterol's values of 4.5 and lower, whereas for the higher cholesterol's values there seems to be none or very week relationship between those two variables for this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. There seems to be a positive relationship between cancer rates and life expectancy: the older one gets, the higher the probability that one will be diagnosed with cancer. This is a very intuitive observation, as people around the world tend to face more and more health difficulties as they are getting older, which makes it very clear that there is probably a third variable or a set of variables, that affects this relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. There seem to be no linear relationship between industry employment in Somalia and life expectancy. Moreover, the percentage of industrial employers is very low and stable across all the years, around 4 to 5%. However, the higher values of life expectancy are more likely to be found for industrial rates higher than 5%, than for the rates below that threshold. When interpreting this figure, we need to keep in mind the very difficult socio-economic situation in Somalia. With ongoing wars, terrorist attacks, and high unemployment rates, the chances for industrial employment might be of bigger importance, to sustain life, which will assessed later on in analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. There is no correlation between smoking rates and life expectancy, which is quite expected giving the low quality of Smoking data frame. "

    "The following observation can be drawn based on the above figure: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is a positive correlation between BMI and life expectancy: the higher the BMI, the higher one's life span, or with another words the older one gets, the higher his/her BMI. The BMI range is smaller and higher than that recorded in Somalia, although still in the range of being healthy. \n",
    " \n",
    "2. There is a negative correlation between levels of 'bad' cholesterol in blood and life expectancy: people with the lowest measurements on this variable tend to live the longest. For all of the data points, the measurements of the cholesterol are higher than those from Somalia's data. Cholesterol seems to be closely and negatively related to life expectancy in both datasets, which gives me the intuition that it might be one of the strongest indicators for life expectancy in this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In contrary to Somalia's dataset, there is a negative relationship between cancer rates and life expectancy: the lower the cancer rates, the higher the life expectancy. Caution is needed when interpreting those differences between the countries. At its highest point, the cancer rates in Switzerland are almost four times of the values of Somalia's ones, those pronounced differences in cancer rates might affect the dependent variable in a differing manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There seem to be a negative, linear relationship between industry employment in Switzerland and life expectancy. The percentage of industrial employers is roughly three times higher than Somalia's rates, and it shows a systematic decrease in the last 10 years of the dataset. Considering the political and economical situation in Switzerland will help to understand the magnitude of this relationship. Switzerland is the second most developed country in the world, with a very stable economy, high political autonomy, and one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe. Therefore working in an industry sector in Switzerland, might be perceived as a risk factor, causing premature deaths, the significance of this observation will be tested in the analyses later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Similarly, there is no correlation between smoking rates and life expectancy, due to the low predictive value of Smoking data frame."

By this, we can assume that our model is linear, and can move forward to statistical analyses applying that method. "

    "To perform statistical analyses a data frame can't have any missing values. However, the year-range for Industry and Smoking data frames are shorter than for the rest of the variables, causing a lot of missing values. Between dropping the Industry and Smoking data frames and performing the analyses without them or filling the missing values and include all independent variables into the model, I chose the latter one. The above visualization suggests that industrial rates might be a strong indicator of life expectancy, so I definitely want to test it. \n",

First I will use sklearn to fit a multivariate linear regression, and calculate the needed coefficients. Later on, I will use statsmodels to implement the ordinary least square estimations of the coefficients. The advantage of the latter one is that it provides the most optimal set of coefficient values, aiming to produce the lowest possible root square error. Moreover, all the estimations done with the OLS are provided with the p-values, indicating their significance. \n",

    "With so calculated coefficients we are able to predict Y: life expectancy giving the values of the model predictors: independent variables. The coefficients in Somalia and Switzerland are highly different for each of the variables, suggesting differences in directionality and magnitude of their relationship with the dependent variable. Comparing these results, with the above-performed visualizations cause some discrepancies. For example, the visualizations revealed a negative relationship between cholesterol levels and life expectancy, whereas here Somalia's coefficient for cholesterol has a positive value. Another discrepancy is the above depicted negative correlation between rates of industrial employees and life expectancy in Switzerland and the positive coefficient in the table above. Lastly, the negative value of BMI for Switzerland is also not in accordance with the above visualizations.\n",

The root square error can have a value between 0 and 1, and it states the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the variance in the independent variable(s). In the above example, we can see that 99 and 94% of the variance in life expectancy, can be explained by the models' parameters. \n",

    " > The single strongest predictor of life expectancy is the **BMI**, with the Adj. R-squared value of 0.86 and RSS of 35.62. The best-fitting model for the Somalian data set is composed of **BMI** and **Industry**, as it increases the Adj. R-squared value up to 0.93, and lowess the RSS to 18.71. Adding additional variables doesn't increase the value of model predictability, and only marginally decrease the RSS. With the marginal difference in a parameter value, we need to ask ourselves the question if upgrading of the model (accounting here for reduction of the RSS by 0.72) is worth the cost of that additional parameter(s) (collecting the additional data and performing the additional analyses). Further on, when can also see that the two variables composing the best-fit model based on R-squared and RSS, were also the two significant variables from the OLS-table, which strengthens my conclusions. \n",

    " > **Switzerland**\n",
    " > The single strongest predictor of life expectancy is **Cholesterol**, with the Adj. R-squared of 0.99, and RSS of 0.68. Adding variable Cancer Rates to the model helps to decrease the RSS up to 0.27, while adding any other parameters, have almost no effect on the predictive value of the model. That is why I would conclude that model compose of **Cholesterol** and **Cancer** is the best-fitting one. The only discrepancy here is that the OLS-technique also estimates the value of the Smoking variable as being highly significant (p<0.001), while here this variable is estimated as not adding any predictive value to the model (R-squared = 0). It might be caused by the fact that the Adj.R-squared value in OLS-technique is calculated for the totality of the model, while above we were able to calculate the R-squared for each of the variables separately. In this case, the Smoking parameter proved to add zero predictive value to the model, despite the fact that its t-test value appeared to be significant."

    " > Do, and if yes how the developing and developed countries differ in terms of the predictive value of the independent variables? \n",
    " \n",
    " > When considering the discrepancies between developing and developed countries on the predictive value of independent variables, we can see that BMI and Cholesterol are the strongest, single predictors of life expectancy in developing, and developed countries, respectively, with higher BMI, and lower cholesterol levels being associated with longer life span. It illustrates very well the general economic situation in each of the countries. When, *in developing countries, the chances of one' s survivor might dependent highly on the accessibility of food* (hence being related to one's BMI), *the omnipresence of the food in the developed counties*,  might influence one's dietary choices, which might account for higher cholesterol level, *being broadly associated with a wide spectrum of cardiovascular disorders, shortening one's life span*. Further on, in developed countries are the Industry Rates, the second strongest, and the second most frequently chosen parameter accounting for the best fit, whereas this variable has very little predictive value in models of developed countries. Moreover, the positive value of the Industry coefficient indicates that the higher the industry rates, the higher life expectancy, which makes sense as *a stable income in developing countries might be of big importance for a survival chance, whereas in developed countries citizens might count for some kind of dole*. Lastly, enlarging the model by adding additional parameters for developing countries, significantly increases the predictive value of the model, from 0.86 (when the model includes 1 parameter) to 0.93 (for the best-fit model). On the other hand, addition of parameters for developed countries doesn't increase the predictive value of the model, as Adj. R-squared increases from 0.99 (for 1 parameter) to 1 (for the best fit-model), the only gain is to be found in the reduction of residual errors by 0.41."

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    " > The following limitations can account for inreliability of the drawn conclusions: \n",
    " \n",
    " 1. The missing values: the choice of filling method is always to some extent a subjective choice. When making such a decision, even when to our knowledge we are choosing the best possible method, we need to be aware that those estimations will contain prediction errors, which is avoidable in data set without missing values.\n",
    " 2. The shorter year range for Industry and Smoking variables: it accounts for lower power of those indicators in comparison to the variables with more data points, as well as lowest the quality of the data as I needed to run the estimates for missing values. \n",
    " 3. Substituting the data set: as there was no available data on the smoking rates in Somalia, I used Chad's statistics instead. However, the actual values of the Somalian female smokers could be significantly different.\n",
    " 4. The generalization of the data: the choice of the countries for the current project, although guided by HDI ranking, was after all a personal one. It is possible that by choosing other countries, or including more of them into the analyses, we would get different results. So, there is a little justification to generalize the above findings to the categories of developing and developed countries. Another reason limiting the generalizability of the results is the fact that no male data was used to answer the research questions.  \n",
    " 5. The choice of predictors: similarly, although an external source pointed these particular independent variables, as one commonly considered to be risk factors for premature death, it is possible that a different set of predictors, could account for a better model. Moreover, it is possible that the observed interactions are in reality moderate or caused by a third variable or a set of variables that were not included in my models. \n",
    " 6. The multicolinearity of predictors: one of the assumptions of the multivariate, linear regression is that the chosen parameters are independent of each other. However, this assumption was not tested for this project, which might result in an increased variance of regression's coefficients. \n",
    " 7. Not checking for all of the assumptions of the linear regression: the only assumption that was checked for this project was the linearity of the relationships, which was tested using visual representations. Testing of the remaining assumptions of the linear regressions were, in my opinion, out of scope for this project.\n",
    " \n",
    " However, I would like to add that no real data will conform exactly to linear regression assumptions. Some violations make the results worthless, others are usually trivial. If the data points are close to independent, and there are no obvious patterns in the data or large outliers, the data set has at least 30 observations per parameter, and the dependent and independent variables have roughly linear relations over the range of the independent variables; the results should be reasonably reliable over that same range. However, in the absence of some strong theoretical insight, it is dangerous to extrapolate the results outside that range or generalize the results."
